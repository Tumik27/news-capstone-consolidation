# News Capstone — Django Application

This repository contains my **Django News Application Capstone Project**, completed as part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering programme.

The goal of this project was not only to build a working Django application, but also to demonstrate professional development practices such as:

- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Writing clear, maintainable code with proper documentation
- Generating developer-friendly documentation using Sphinx
- Containerising the application using Docker for consistent deployment

This repository is intended to be part of my **developer portfolio**.

It demonstrates key Django concepts such as:

- Custom user models
- Role-based logic
- Model relationships
- Clean project structure
- Environment-based configuration
