# News Capstone — Django Application

This repository contains my **Django News Application Capstone Project**, completed as part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering programme.

The goal of this project was not only to build a working Django application, but also to demonstrate professional development practices such as:

- Version control with Git and GitHub  
- Writing clear, maintainable code  
- Generating developer documentation using Sphinx  
- Containerising an application using Docker  

This repository is intended to form part of my **developer portfolio**.

## Project Overview

The News Application allows different user roles (Readers, Journalists, Editors) to interact with news articles in a structured workflow.

It demonstrates key Django concepts such as:

- Custom user models  
- Role-based permissions  
- Model relationships  
- API endpoints  
- Clean project structure
